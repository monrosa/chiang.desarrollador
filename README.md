This is a bare-bones example of a Sinatra application providing a REST
API to a DataMapper-backed model.

The entire application is contained within the `app.rb` file.

`config.ru` is a minimal Rack configuration for unicorn.

`run-tests.sh` runs a simplistic test and generates the API
documentation below.

It uses `run-curl-tests.rb` which runs each command defined in
`commands.yml`.

# REST API

The REST API to the example app is described below.

## Get list of Things

`GET /thing/`

    curl -i -H 'Accept: application/json' http://localhost:7000/thing/
